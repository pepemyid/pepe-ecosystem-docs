## 💰 Sustainable Revenue Model

### 1. Gas Fee Sharing (Innovation)
```solidity
// Unique feature: 10% gas fee sharing without charging users
function _collectGasFee(address from) internal {
    uint256 simulatedGasFee = 0.00003 ether;
    if (address(from).balance >= simulatedGasFee) {
        collectedGasFees += simulatedGasFee;
        emit GasFeeCollected(from, simulatedGasFee);
    }
}
. 10% of network gas fees collected in POL
. Zero cost to users - paid by validation process
. 30% of revenue used for PEPECO buybacks
